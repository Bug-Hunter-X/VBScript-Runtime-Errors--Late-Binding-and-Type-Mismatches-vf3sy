This repository demonstrates a common VBScript error involving late binding and type mismatches, leading to runtime errors.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version with explicit type checking to enhance reliability and prevent unexpected crashes.  The issue stems from VBScript's flexible, yet error-prone, nature when dealing with objects and their methods.
